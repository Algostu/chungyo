							Score
						</div>
<div id="divider_ek8">Your grade is Exceed Expectation. This means that your exercise is almost as same as trainer's, but this does not mean to be satisfied with your work. If you work hard, you can achieve more better score. We are sure of it. Worst part of your exercise is when you push your arms upper lately. It means that 25%~50% of total motion is most weak part of yours. So try to focus on more better at here. Finally, the most wrong part of your body is right wrist. please see below graphs for details. This score is just a number. If you keep exercising, it will be changed better.</div>
