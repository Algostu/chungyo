## Contributor License Agreement

We'd love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few legal requirements sorted out. By having you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), we ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

When you contribute to the CHUNGYO project with a new pull request, a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on the pull request,  including a link to accept the agreement. The [individual CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf) document is available for review as a PDF.
